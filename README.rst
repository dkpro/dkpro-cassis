DKPro **cassis** (pronunciation: [ka.sis]) provides a pure-Python implementation of the *Common Analysis System* (CAS)
as defined by the `UIMA <https://uima.apache.org>`_ framework. The CAS is a data structure representing an object to
be enrichted with annotations (the co-called *Subject of Analysis*, short *SofA*).

This library enables the creation and manipulation of CAS objects and their associated type systems as well as loading
and saving CAS objects in the `CAS XMI XML representation <https://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-current/references.html#ugr.ref.xmi>`_
in Python programs. This can ease in particular the integration of Python-based Natural Language Processing (e.g.
`spacy <https://spacy.io>`_ or `NLTK <https://www.nltk.org>`_) and Machine Learning librarys (e.g.
`scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_ or `Keras <https://keras.io>`_) in UIMA-based text analysis workflows.

An example of cassis in action is the `spacy recommender for INCEpTION <https://github.com/inception-project/external-recommender-spacy>`_,
which wraps the spacy NLP library as a web service which can be used in conjunction with the `INCEpTION <https://inception-project.github.io>`_
text annotation platform to automatically generate annotation suggestions.

Features
------------

Currently supported features are:

- Text SofAs
- Deserializing/serializing UIMA CAS from/to XMI
- Deserializing/serializing type systems from/to XML
- Selecting annotations, selecting covered annotations, adding
  annotations
- Type inheritance
- Multiple SofA support
- Type system can be changed after loading
- Reference, array and list features

Some features are still under development, e.g.

- Proper type checking
- XML/XMI schema validation
- Type unmarshalling from string to the actual type specified in the type system

Installation
------------

To install the package with :code:`pip`, just run

    pip install dkpro-cassis

Usage
-----

Example CAS XMI and types system files can be found under :code:`tests\test_files`.

Loading a CAS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A CAS can be deserialized from XMI either by reading from a file or
string using :code:`load_cas_from_xmi`.

.. code:: python

    from cassis import *

    with open('typesystem.xml', 'rb') as f:
        typesystem = load_typesystem(f)
        
    with open('cas.xml', 'rb') as f:
       cas = load_cas_from_xmi(f, typesystem=typesystem)

Saving a CAS as XMI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A CAS can be serialized to XMI either by writing to a file or be
returned as a string using :code:`cas.to_xmi()`.

.. code:: python

    from cassis import *

    with open('cas.xml', 'rb') as f:
       cas = load_cas_from_xmi(f)

    # Returned as a string
    xmi = cas.to_xmi()

    # Written to file
    cas.to_xmi("my_cas.xmi")

Adding annotations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a type system with a type :code:`cassis.Token` that has an :code:`id` and
:code:`pos` feature, annotations can be added in the following:

.. code:: python

    from cassis import *

    with open('typesystem.xml', 'rb') as f:
        typesystem = load_typesystem(f)
        
    with open('cas.xml', 'rb') as f:
        cas = load_cas_from_xmi(f, typesystem=typesystem)
       
    Token = typesystem.get_type('cassis.Token')

    tokens = [
        Token(begin=0, end=3, id='0', pos='NNP'),
        Token(begin=4, end=10, id='1', pos='VBD'),
        Token(begin=11, end=14, id='2', pos='IN'),
        Token(begin=15, end=18, id='3', pos='DT'),
        Token(begin=19, end=24, id='4', pos='NN'),
        Token(begin=25, end=26, id='5', pos='.'),
    ]

    for token in tokens:
        cas.add_annotation(token)

Selecting annotations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from cassis import *

    with open('typesystem.xml', 'rb') as f:
        typesystem = load_typesystem(f)
        
    with open('cas.xml', 'rb') as f:
        cas = load_cas_from_xmi(f, typesystem=typesystem)

    for sentence in cas.select('cassis.Sentence'):
        for token in cas.select_covered('cassis.Token', sentence):
            print(token.get_covered_text())
            
            # Annotation values can be accessed as properties
            print('Token: begin={0}, end={1}, id={2}, pos={3}'.format(token.begin, token.end, token.id, token.pos)) 

Selecting nested features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have nested feature structures, e.g. a feature structure  with feature :code:`a` that has a
feature :code:`b` that has a feature :code:`c`, some of which can be :code:`None`, then you can use the
following:

.. code:: python

    fs.get("a.b.c")


If :code:`a` or  :code:`b` or  :code:`c` are :code:`None`, then this returns instead of
throwing an error.

Another example would be a StringList containing :code:`["Foo", "Bar", "Baz"]`:

.. code:: python

    assert lst.get("head") == "foo"
    assert lst.get("tail.head") == "bar"
    assert lst.get("tail.tail.head") == "baz"
    assert lst.get("tail.tail.tail.head") == None
    assert lst.get("tail.tail.tail.tail.head") == None

Creating types and adding features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from cassis import *

    typesystem = TypeSystem()

    parent_type = typesystem.create_type(name='example.ParentType')
    typesystem.add_feature(type_=parent_type, name='parentFeature', rangeTypeName='String')

    child_type = typesystem.create_type(name='example.ChildType', supertypeName=parent_type.name)
    typesystem.add_feature(type_=child_type, name='childFeature', rangeTypeName='Integer')

    annotation = child_type(parentFeature='parent', childFeature='child')

When adding new features, these changes are propagated. For example,
adding a feature to a parent type makes it available to a child type.
Therefore, the type system does not need to be frozen for consistency.
The type system can be changed even after loading, it is not frozen
like in UIMAj.

Sofa support
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Sofa represents some form of an unstructured artifact that is processed in a UIMA pipeline. It contains for instance
the document text. Currently, new Sofas can be created. This is automatically done when creating a new view. Basic
properties of the Sofa can be read and written:

.. code:: python

    cas = Cas()
    cas.sofa_string = "Joe waited for the train . The train was late ."
    cas.sofa_mime = "text/plain"

    print(cas.sofa_string)
    print(cas.sofa_mime)

Managing views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A view into a CAS contains a subset of feature structures and annotations. One view corresponds to exactly one Sofa. It
can also be used to query and alter information about the Sofa, e.g. the document text. Annotations added to one view
are not visible in another view.  A view Views can be created and changed. A view has the same methods and attributes
as a :code:`Cas` .

.. code:: python

    from cassis import *

    with open('typesystem.xml', 'rb') as f:
        typesystem = load_typesystem(f)
    Token = typesystem.get_type('cassis.Token')

    # This creates automatically the view `_InitialView`
    cas = Cas()
    cas.sofa_string = "I like cheese ."

    cas.add_annotations([
        Token(begin=0, end=1),
        Token(begin=2, end=6),
        Token(begin=7, end=13),
        Token(begin=14, end=15)
    ])

    print([x.get_covered_text() for x in cas.select_all()])

    # Create a new view and work on it.
    view = cas.create_view('testView')
    view.sofa_string = "I like blackcurrant ."

    view.add_annotations([
        Token(begin=0, end=1),
        Token(begin=2, end=6),
        Token(begin=7, end=19),
        Token(begin=20, end=21)
    ])

    print([x.get_covered_text() for x in view.select_all()])

Merging type systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, it is desirable to merge two type systems. With **cassis**, this can be
achieved via the :code:`merge_typesystems` function. The detailed rules of merging can be found
`here <https://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-2.10.4/references.html#ugr.ref.cas.typemerging>`_.

.. code:: python

    from cassis import *

    with open('typesystem.xml', 'rb') as f:
        typesystem = load_typesystem(f)

    ts = merge_typesystems([typesystem, load_dkpro_core_typesystem()])

Type checking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When adding annotations, no type checking is performed for simplicity reasons.
In order to check types, call the :code:`cas.typecheck()` method. Currently, it only
checks whether elements in uima.cas.FSArray` or :code:`uima.cas.FSList` are
adhere to the specified :code:`elementType`.

DKPro Core Integration
----------------------

A CAS using the DKPro Core Type System can be created via

.. code:: python

    from cassis import *

    cas = Cas(typesystem=load_dkpro_core_typesystem())

    for t in cas.typesystem.get_types():
        print(t)

Miscellaneous
-------------

If feature names clash with Python magic variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your type system defines a type called :code:`self` or :code:`type`, then it will be made
available as a member variable :code:`self_` or :code:`type_` on the respective type:

.. code:: python

    from cassis import *

    typesystem = TypeSystem()

    ExampleType = typesystem.create_type(name='example.Type')
    typesystem.add_feature(type_=ExampleType, name='self', rangeTypeName='String')
    typesystem.add_feature(type_=ExampleType, name='type', rangeTypeName='String')

    annotation = ExampleType(self_="Test string1", type_="Test string2")

    print(annotation.self_)
    print(annotation.type_)

Leniency
~~~~~~~~

If the type for a feature structure is not found in the typesystem, it will raise an exception by default.
If you want to ignore these kind of errors, you can pass :code:`lenient=True` to the :code:`Cas` constructor or
to :code:`load_cas_from_xmi`.
