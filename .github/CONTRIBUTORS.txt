#
# Code integrated from third parties by others than their original authors may not have any
# @author tags removed and respective names must not be added to this file. Integration of
# third party code should be avoided.

# After the name, one or more mail addresses may be specified in pointy brackets and one or more
# GitHub IDs may be specified in square brackets.
